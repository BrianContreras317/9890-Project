# 9890-Project

By Brian Contreras and Troy Whittemore

For this project, we used data from https://www.kaggle.com/ananaymital/us-used-cars-dataset. This file was over 9GB, and was mostly empty data, so we reduced it to what we attached. We also used a file from https://simplemaps.com/data/us-zips in order to turn the zip code column into state, so that we would have less factors (from over 6000 to 50). We did a lot of data cleaning, but in the end we got our data down to around 70,000 rows and 40 predictors. Here, I am attaching the data file we used (after cleaning our original data) and the code used to create our models.
